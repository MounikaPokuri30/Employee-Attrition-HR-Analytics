After building the dashbaord, some of the factors that contributed to the high attrition rate in 149 Solutions are as follows:
- `Job role`: Most of the employees who left the company were laboratory technicians and sales executives.
- `Years with the current manager`: Most of the employees who left the company had reported to their current manager for less than a year.
- `Number of companies`: Employees who worked in only one company before working at 149 Solutions contributed the highest to the attrition rate.

The following are some more attributes where you can see a clear trend towards lower employee retention:
- `Gender`: A large number of male employees left the company as compared with female employees.
- `Job role and number of companies`: Laboratory technicians who worked in only one company before 149 solutions contributed the most to the attrition rate.
